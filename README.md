# Face-Emotion-Recognition
Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks


## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Desciription Of Model
Computer vision (CV) can recognize and tell you what your emotion is by just looking at your facial expressions.OpenCV and webcam are used in this program to check emotions in real time. The program is a computer vision model created using VGG16, a variant of Keras and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Dataset
The dataset contains 48 X 48-pixel grayscale images of the face. There are seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral) present in the data.
